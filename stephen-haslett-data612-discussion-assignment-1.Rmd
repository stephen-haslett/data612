## Research Question
Choose one commercial recommender and describe how you think it works (content-based, collaborative filtering, etc). Does the technique deliver a good experience or are the recommendations off-target?

## The Netflix Recommender System
Netflix utilizes a recommender system that tailors it's extensive media catalog to the interests of individual subscribers. Over 80% of the content people watch on Netflix is discovered through this system, making it an integral part of the service. The system consists of a series of algorithms (based on search, ranking, similarity, ratings, etc.) that analyze the viewing habits of subscribers in order to place them into taste groups. The taste groups that a subscriber belongs to determine what media is used to populate their home screen.

Netflix groups viewing recommendations by genre, and displays them as a series of rows on the subscriber's home screen. This makes it easy for the subscriber to quickly decide if the recommendations that populate a row are worth watching, or if they should jump to the next row.

The system utilizes five major algorithms in order to generate and populate these rows:

#### 1. Personalized Video Ranker (PVR) Algorithm
Categorizes and orders content into rows based on an individual user's viewing history. So for example, if a viewer regularly watches comedy and romance movies, then the system will add a comedy and romance row to the user's profile page containing recommended content for these genres.

#### 2. Top N Video Ranker Algorithm
Responsible for creating and populating the Top Picks row on a user's profile. This algorithm searches the entire content catalog for top ranking personalized recommendations for a particular user, and adds them to the Top Picks row.

#### 3. Trending Now Algorithm
Generates and populates the Trending Now row on a user's profile page. The algorithm uses the viewing histories, ratings, and activities of all members to populate this row. Additionally, the algoritm takes into account realtime events when deciding which content it should serve. For example, on Valentine's Day the trending now row is likely to contain a lot of romance based movies and shows.

#### 4. Continue Watching Algorithm
Populates the Continue Watching row based on the probability that a user will continue watching a show or movie. It also factors in contextual data such as time passed since last viewing, and at what point in the show/movie did the user stop watching, to determine what content makes it into this row.

#### 5. The Video-Video Similarity Algorithm
Creates and populates the "Because You Watched" rows on a user's profile.

### Does the technique deliver a good experience or are the recommendations off-target?
