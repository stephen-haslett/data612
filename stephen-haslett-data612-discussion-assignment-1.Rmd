## Research Question
Choose one commercial recommender and describe how you think it works (content-based, collaborative filtering, etc.). Does the technique deliver a good experience or are the recommendations off-target?

## The Netflix Recommender System
Netflix utilizes a recommender system that tailors its extensive media catalog to the interests of individual subscribers. Over 80% of the content people watch on Netflix is discovered through this system, making it an integral part of the service. The system consists of a series of algorithms (based on search, ranking, similarity, ratings, etc.) that analyze the viewing habits of subscribers in order to place them into taste groups. The taste groups that a subscriber belongs to determine what media is used to populate their home screen.

The system utilizes both user based collaborative filtering (in that it groups subscribers into taste groups based on their viewing habits), and content based filtering. The content based filtering is likely used to offset the fact that the system does not have viewing profiles for new subscribers. Content based filtering can therefore be used as a catalyst to generate these profiles.

Netflix groups viewing recommendations by genre, and displays them as a series of rows on the subscriber's home screen. This makes it easy for the subscriber to quickly decide if the recommendations that populate a row are worth watching, or if they should jump to the next row.

The system utilizes five major algorithms in order to generate and populate these rows:

#### 1. Personalized Video Ranker (PVR) Algorithm
Categorizes and orders content into rows based on an individual user's viewing history. So for example, if a viewer regularly watches comedy and romance movies, then the system will add a comedy and romance row to the user's profile page containing recommended content for these genres.

#### 2. Top N Video Ranker Algorithm
Responsible for creating and populating the Top Picks row on a user's profile. This algorithm searches the entire content catalog for top ranking personalized recommendations for a particular user, and adds them to the Top Picks row.

#### 3. Trending Now Algorithm
Generates and populates the Trending Now row on a user's profile page. The algorithm uses the viewing histories, ratings, and activities of all members to populate this row. Additionally, the algorithm takes into account real-time events when deciding which content it should serve. For example, on Valentine's Day the trending now row is likely to contain a lot of romance based movies and shows.

#### 4. Continue Watching Algorithm
Populates the Continue Watching row based on the probability that a user will continue watching a show or movie. It also factors in contextual data such as time passed since last viewing, and at what point in the show/movie did the user stop watching, to determine what content makes it into this row.

#### 5. The Video-Video Similarity Algorithm
Creates and populates the "Because You Watched" rows on a user's profile. This algorithm takes a movie or show that was watched by a user, and searches for similar content. It then calculates the similarity of that content, and populates the row with the most similar items. Out of the five algorithms, this is the least personalized algorithm.

### Conclusion
Netflix currently has 182.8 million subscribers, and a high customer retention rate, which suggests that their recommendation system is effective. In terms of user experience, speaking from my own experience as a Netflix subscriber, I am satisfied with the experience and find their suggestions useful when searching for new content.


## Attacks on Recommender Systems
Read the article below and consider how to handle attacks on recommender systems. Can you think of a similar example where a collective effort to alter the workings of content recommendations have been successful? How would you design a system to prevent this kind of abuse?

Travis M. Andrews, The Washington Post (2017): Wisdom of the crowd? IMDb users gang up on Christian Baleâ€™s new movie before it even opens.

A similar example of this was the apparent use of bots to drive down the audience score for 'The Last Jedi' on the entertainment review site Rotten Tomatoes. The anti Disney Facebook group "Down With Disney's Treatment of Franchises and its Fanboys" claimed that they created bot Facebook accounts to log into Rotten Tomatoes and review bomb the movie.

Apparently, the site uses reCAPTCHA to prevent bots from creating fake accounts. However, the site also offers the option to signup via Facebook, which allows users to bypass the reCAPTCHA check. Therefore, the first step in preventing such an attack would obviously be to remove that option. Additionally, the site could use multi-factor authentication to authenticate users before allowing them to submit a review.
