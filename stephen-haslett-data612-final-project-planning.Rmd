## Assignment Instructions
Find an interesting dataset and describe the system you plan to build out. If you would like to use one of the datasets you have already worked with, you should add a unique element or incorporate additional data. (i.e. explicit features you scrape from another source, like image analysis on movie posters). The overall goal, however, will be to produce quality recommendations by extracting insights from a large dataset. You may do so using Spark, or another distributed computing method, OR by effectively applying one of the more advanced mathematical techniques we have covered. There is no preference for one over the other, as long as your recommender works!

## Dataset
The dataset I will use for this project is the [*Amazon - Ratings (Beauty Products)*](https://www.kaggle.com/skillsmuggler/amazon-ratings) dataset which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). The dataset consists of over 2 million reviews and ratings from Amazon on Beauty related products, and consists of 4 columns: UserId, ProductId, 
Rating, and Timestamp.
